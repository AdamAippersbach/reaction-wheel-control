    "## State Space Modelling\n",
    "From the literature, most groups are using state space\n",
    "modelling with quaternion error control. In linear state space modelling,\n",
    "the system is described by the state vector $\\textbf{x}(t)$, the\n",
    "control inputs $\\textbf{u}(t)$, and the state equations:\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "\\begin{split}\n",
    "\\dot{\\textbf{x}}(t) &= \\textbf{A}(t)\\textbf{x}(t) + \\textbf{B}(t)\\textbf{u}(t) \\\\\n",
    "\\textbf{y}(t) &= \\textbf{C}(t)\\textbf{y}(t) + \\textbf{D}(t)\\textbf{u}(t)\n",
    "\\end{split}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "where $\\textbf{y}$ is the outputs of the system, and $\\textbf{A}$,\n",
    "$\\textbf{B}$, $\\textbf{C}$, $\\textbf{D}$ are matrices that can\n",
    "be solved for either analytically or numerically depending on\n",
    "the dynamics and kinematics of the system and in general all have time\n",
    "dpendence. I am going to drop the explicit time dependence because it\n",
    "is a pain to write but remember that in general there is always \n",
    "time dependence. \n",
    "\n",
    "For non-linear state space modeling the state space equation is more\n",
    "general:\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "\\begin{split}\n",
    "\\dot{\\textbf{x}}(t) &= \\textbf{f}(t, x(t), u(t)) \\\\ \n",
    "\\textbf{y}(t) &= \\textbf{h} (t, x(t), u(t))\n",
    "\\end{split}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "Every paper I find online says that the reaction wheel + satellite system\n",
    "is a non-linear one, so we should expect our equations to take the above\n",
    "form and be messy. All the info stated above was taken right from the state\n",
    "space modelling Wiki which gives an intelligable description of state space\n",
    "representation: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State-space_representation . \n",
    "There is also a 4 part series by MATLAB which I watched a bit of that offers a \n",
    "conceptual overview of state space modelling that may be helpful:\n",

    "My understanding is that we have some freedom in how we want to choose our \n",
    "state vector. There doesn't seem to be a unique state vector for a system but\n",
    "instead one is chosen depending on the relevant physical characteristics\n",
    "of the system. My gut feeling is that the state vector will have\n",
    "to have, at the very least, the orientation of the satellite $\\mathbf{q}$,\n",
    "the angular velocity of the satellite $\\mathbf{\\omega}$, and maybe the\n",
    "angular momentum of the reaction wheels $\\mathbf{h}_w$. Likewise we\n",
    "have freedom to choose our output $\\mathbf{y}$ and input $\\mathbf{u}$.\n",
    "I think that the output will be an updated state vector but I am not\n",
    "sure. $u$ will probably depend on the quaternion error between the\n",
    "desired orientation and the current orientation mutliplied by some\n",
    "gain matrices. The gain matrices, often denoted by $\\textbf{K}$ are\n",
    "what determine the control of the system and there are different\n",
    "methods for how to tune them. An example is LQR control which\n",
    "is explained in one of the videos above.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Plan of Attack\n",
    "This is how I see it at a high level:\n",
    "1. Derive expressions for $\\textbf{f}(t, x(t), u(t))$ and $\\textbf{h}(t, x(t), u(t))$\n",
    "  from the kinematics and dynamics of the system.\n",
    "2. Linearize $\\textbf{f}$ and $\\textbf{h}$ using a well known technique.\n",
    "3. Once the equations are linearized we should have expressions for\n",
    "  $\\textbf{A}$, $\\textbf{B}$, $\\textbf{C}$ and $\\textbf{D}$ so we can\n",
    "  use a variety of tools in MATLAB to simulate and design the controller.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Deriving $\\textbf{f}(t, x(t), u(t)$ and $\\textbf{h}(t, x(t), u(t))$\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to emphasize that if we know the kinematics and \n",
    "dynamics, the system should be fully defined in the physical sense.\n",
    "From what I can find, all this information seems to be contained\n",
    "in two equations:\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "\\begin{split}\n",
    "\\textbf{T} &= \\frac{d\\mathbf{h}}{dt} + \\mathbf{\\omega} \\times \\textbf{h} \\\\\n",
    "\\frac{d\\mathbf{q}}{dt} &= \\frac{1}{2} \\mathbf{ \\Omega(\\omega)} \\textbf{q}\n",
    "\\end{split}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "I got both of these from the Sidi textbook on attitude control. The\n",
    "first equation is called the Euler moment equation and the second equation\n",
    "describes how the quaternion, $\\textbf{q}$, which describes the orientation of the satellite\n",
    "changes with time. It seems that there are three main methods for describing\n",
    "orientation: Euler angles, Quaternions and Cosine Matrices. Cosine matrices\n",
    "seem to be the fundamental mathematical idea but no one uses them. Euler\n",
    "angles are a prescription for which order to rotate your axes when you\n",
    "are transforming from one frame to another. They are easy to visualize but\n",
    "apparently have \"singularities\". That leaves quaternions. I don't have a good\n",
    "idea of what a queternion is or how it is derived, but the take home points\n",
    "are:\n",
    "* they are a four-dimensional vector which completely describes the orientation\n",
    "  of an object.\n",
    "* there are well defined transformations to get between quaternions and Euler angles.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since everyone in aerospace controls uses them, I am fine to push forward using\n",
    "them and learn along the way. From Sidi, $\\textbf{T}$ is the total external torque \n",
    "on the system, $\\textbf{h}$ should be the total angular momentum of the system,\n",
    "and $\\omega$ is the angular velocity. I think whether $\\omega$ is $\\omega_s$\n",
    "(the angular velocity of the satellite) or $\\omega_w$ (the angular velocity\n",
    "of the wheel) depends on which coordinate system you are writing the Euler\n",
    "moment equation in. A derivation of the Euler moment equation with particular\n",
    "care to note the reference frames and $\\omega$'s could confirm this. In the \n",
    "quaternion equation, $\\mathbf{\\Omega}$ looks like:\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "\\mathbf{\\Omega}(\\mathbf{\\omega}) = \n",
    "\\begin{bmatrix}\n",
    "0 &\\omega_3 & -\\omega_2 & \\omega_1 \\\\\n",
    "-\\omega_3 & 0 & \\omega_1 & \\omega_2 \\\\\n",

    "-\\omega_1 & -\\omega_2 & -\\omega_3 & 0\n",
    "\\end{bmatrix}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "The equation is telling us that the satellite changes as function\n",
    "of the angular velocity $\\mathbf{\\omega}$, which makes sense.\n",
    "\n",
    "So how are we going to go about deriving expressions for $\\textbf{f}$\n",
    "and $\\textbf{h}$? I think I made some progress on that.\n",
    "Consider the state vector will be something like\n",
    "$\\textbf{x} = [\\mathbf{\\omega_s}, \\mathbf{q_s}]$ or \n",
    "$\\textbf{x} = [\\mathbf{\\omega_s}, \\mathbf{q}_s, \\textbf{h}_s]$ and we want to\n",
    "find expressions for $\\dot{\\textbf{x}}$ e.g. expressions for \n",
    "$\\dot{\\mathbf{\\omega_s}}$ and $\\dot{\\textbf{q}}_s$ and maybe $\\textbf{h}_s$.\n",
    "Lucky for us, we already know what $\\dot{\\textbf{q}}_s$ is namely:\n",
